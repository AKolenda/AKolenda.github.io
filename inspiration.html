                        One of my most favorite inspirations is Elon Musk. Elon is a unique individual with many qualities that make him a strong leader. Elon has a vast portfolio, but some of the most interesting has been:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Help found and code Zip2</li>
                            <li>Helped found and code the basis of PayPal (formerly X.com)</li>
                            <li>Founded SpaceX</li>
                            <li>CEO of Tesla Inc.</li>
                            <li>Founder of OpenAI</li>
                            <li>Founder of Nerualink</li>
                            <li>Founder of The Boring Company</li>
                        </ul>
    
                        Elon has a vast portfolio that makes him one of the most accomplished people in modern history. Elon is a down to earth guy and does not see him above anyone else. He creates companies on the basis of changing the world rather than pleasing investors.
                        Once foundations of a company are created in revolutionizing the world rather than pandering to investors we get amazing results. Look at SpaceX, they're launching a global satellite constellation that would be able to get 1GB down and 1GB up theoretically anywhere on earth. Even on mount everest.
                        Since SpaceX is not a public company they are not pressured by outside forces and follow their own path. It is evident with Elon at the helm of SpaceX that innovation is at the top of qualities and importances for him.
    
                        It seems like Elon does not waste his time on companies or jobs that would just create money and nothing else. He is more interested in the revolutionizing of the human race. We see this in OpenAI, Nerualink, Boring Company, SpaceX, Tesla. All of these companies have greater ambitions of essentially terraforming earth.
                        Elon is such a perculiar character, he's maticulous. Well thought out and calculated. Nothing he says is not calculated and processed. He has greater ambitions and wont stop until he reaches them. Money just happens to come along with it, rather than being the main objective for him.
